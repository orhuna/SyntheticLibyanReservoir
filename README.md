# Synthetic Libyan Reservoir (SLR) Case

Structural Framework, Geomodels and FLow Simulation Case : Orhun Aydin, 2015 

## Synposis

Synthetic Libyan Reservoir (SLR) contains a flow simulation deck and associated includes (geological model and a structural grid) for a synthetic analog case to a Libyan onshore oil field. This repository contains all of the geological model  for flow simulation using 3DSL&reg; software of Streamsim&trade;.

## Components of the Synthethic Case

### Structural Model 

Structural Model consists of 4 faults and 2 deformable horizons. In this case, a brittle deformation is modeled with no smearing. Structural setting in this case consists of 4 normal faults given below:

Brittly deformed horizons are given is below:

### Stratigraphic Model 

Resulting geologic model for the structural model is given below:

### Flow Simulation Grid 
Finally the flow model from this geologic model is extracted as below:
